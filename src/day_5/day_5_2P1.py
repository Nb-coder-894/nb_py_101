# So here I'm gonna run the code for part one of day 5 2nd print version.
def fireball(power): 
     print("Fireball launched")
     return power * 10
damage = fireball(5) 
print("Someonetakes", damage , "dmg")
# This code returns that someone takes 50 damage.
# So, THATS how you call functions.
# This is the end of this exercise, which taught how to call functions and use them in programming.
