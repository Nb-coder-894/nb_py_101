# What is a STRING in python

  -- String is a special kind of `list` that consists of all the characters you can type and starts with a double(") or single(') quote and end same way.

  ## Example:
  "NIRVAN" is a string
  if "NIRVAN" was a `list` it would look like ``['N', 'I', 'R', 'V', 'A', 'N']`

  Example showing string is nothing but a special type of list
  
  ```>>> my_string = "NIRVAN"
>>> print(f"LENGTH OF MY STRING -> {len(my_string)}")
LENGTH OF MY STRING -> 6
>>> my_list = ['N', 'I', 'R', 'V', 'A', 'N']
>>> print(f"Length of my list -> {len(my_list)}")
Length of my list -> 6
```

 - now english language has 5 vowels, a, e, i , o, u 
 - if the string has all 5 vowels
