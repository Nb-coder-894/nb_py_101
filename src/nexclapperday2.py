"""
Learning about substrings and Taking characters from a string.

substrings are parts of a string that can be assigned to a variable.

For example:

word = "abcdefgh"

x = word[0:3]

print(x)

# This will create an output of "abc"

y = word[0]

# This will create an output of "a".

#2: How to choose random items from a list. 
#To choose random items from a list, first import randint.

from random import randint

items = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

randomVal = randint (0,2)

x = items[randomVal]

print(x)

#This will create a random series of "apple", "banana", etc.

#3: Choosing random characters from a string.

#This is pretty similar to the last thing, but with a single string. I would think that this would combine the effects of substrings and randint.

from random import randint

word = "Three"
